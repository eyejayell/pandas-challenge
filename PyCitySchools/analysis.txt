This analysis looks at reading and math results for students from 9th to 12th grade, compared against the population of these schools, whether they are a 
district or charter school, and the school's funding.


Takeaways from the data:

1) Schools that spent the least amount of money per student demonstrated the highest across ever measure of academic success (average reading and math scores, 
and % of students passing exams for reading, math, and overall)

2) While small- and medium-sized schools (as measured by population of the student body) demonstrated similar results across all measures of success, 
large-sized schools did worse across the board, particularly in the rates at which students in large-sized schools passed their assessments, 
though average scores, while still lower at large-sized schools, did not lag as far behind.

3) Charter Schools performed better by every measure of assessment when compared to District Schools. These performance differences were especially pronounced 
in the rates at which students in Charter Schools passed their assessments. 

4) Grade level did not appear to have a significant impact on the performance of students within their individual schools.
